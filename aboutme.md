Calm, a dreamer (always), still trying to figure out how to get to the world of magic and superpowers.

I like the idea that programming is a super power, a power that comes from the mixture of many others, like joy of learning (continuously and forever), hard work (sometimes smart work) and problem solving. This latter I'm proud to have dealt with some challenges in my career as an assistant in an electric power and automation company.

As there are no limits to our imagination, I am happy that I arrived at the Bootcamp of the Academia de CÃ³digo, filling my imagination to new horizons, where I adopted this culture of the programming world, where I realized that to achieve great powers we have to work hard, work smart, but also having fun and doing the things we like with love and care.

I'm still looking for that way to reach more superpowers, let's find out what's going to happen next on this journey.

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so that's it for now while i try to remember more.
